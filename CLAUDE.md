# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an advanced multi-agent debate and deliberation system using local Ollama models with Langfuse tracing, ChromaDB vector memory, and focus scoring mechanisms. The project has three main modes:

1. **Interactive Chatbot** (`main.py`) - Streaming chat with conversation memory
2. **Council Debate** (`council.cli debate`) - Multi-agent competitive debate with voting, consensus, and real-time focus scoring
3. **Council of Consciousness** (`council.cli consciousness`) - High-context governance council with semantic memory retrieval via ChromaDB

### Key Enhancements (v2)
- **Focus Scoring**: Automatic evaluation of argument relevance to keep debates on-topic
- **ChromaDB Memory**: Advanced vector database for semantic memory retrieval
- **Improved Prompts**: Stricter system prompts enforcing focus and depth
- **Enhanced Display**: Rich terminal UI with panels, progress indicators, and color-coded agents
- **Better Personalities**: More diverse and professional agent archetypes with higher reasoning depth
- **Improved Moderator**: Grand Moderator role with stronger facilitation and focus enforcement

## Architecture

### Core Debate Engine (`council/engine.py`)

The debate system uses an iterative argument-vote-consensus loop:

1. **Argument Generation** (`_prompt_for_argument`): Each personality generates arguments based on their traits, perspective, and prior arguments
2. **Voting** (`_prompt_for_vote`): Agents rank all arguments from best to worst
3. **Consensus Check** (`_consensus_from_votes`): Determines if threshold met by counting first-place votes
4. **Elimination** (optional): Removes worst-performing agent based on aggregate ranking
5. **Judge Decision** (`_prompt_for_judge`): Final synthesis after iterations complete using **kimi-k2:1t-cloud** model (powerful judge with enhanced reasoning)

All streaming uses `_stream_completion` with callbacks for real-time token display.

**Judge Model**: Default is `kimi-k2:1t-cloud`, a high-quality model specifically chosen for:
- Superior reasoning and synthesis capabilities
- Better understanding of complex multi-agent debates
- More nuanced and balanced final decisions
- Higher context window for processing full debate transcripts

### Council of Consciousness (`council/consciousness.py`)

Multi-phase governance deliberation with persistent memory:

1. **Memory Retrieval**: Fetches recent + semantically similar episodes from SQLite
2. **Moderator Opening**: Frames the question and structure
3. **Argument Round**: Each role (philosopher, humanist, critic, spiritualist, technocrat) contributes
4. **Critique Phase**: Dedicated critic analyzes all contributions
5. **Reflection Phase**: Each speaker reflects on critique and others' points
6. **Moderator Closing**: Synthesis and summary
7. **Elimination** (optional): Evaluator suggests weakest contributor

All phases are logged to Markdown (`debates/` folder) and SQLite (`memory/council_memory.db`).

### Memory System (`council/chroma_memory.py`)

**ChromaCouncilMemory** class provides advanced vector memory with ChromaDB:
- **Storage**: ChromaDB persistent client with HNSW indexing and cosine similarity
- **Embedding**: Uses `granite-embedding:latest` via `embed_text()`
- **Retrieval**:
  - `fetch_recent()` - chronological recent episodes with optional filters
  - `fetch_similar()` - semantic similarity search with configurable threshold
  - `search_by_metadata()` - filter by agent, role, phase, question
- **Summarization**: `summarize_memory()` condenses both recent and semantically similar memories
- **Benefits over SQLite**:
  - Optimized vector indexing (HNSW algorithm)
  - Better performance for large memory collections
  - Native similarity search without manual cosine calculation
  - Persistent storage with automatic optimization
  - Metadata filtering combined with vector search

**Legacy SQLite memory** (`council/memory.py`) is still available but deprecated in favor of ChromaDB.

### Focus Scoring System (`council/focus_scorer.py`)

Automatic evaluation system to keep debates on-topic:

- **`score_argument_focus()`**: Scores individual arguments (0.0-1.0) for relevance to the question
  - Uses LLM evaluation with strict rubric
  - Returns `FocusScore` with score, reasoning, and boolean focus flag
  - Configurable threshold (default: 0.7)

- **`batch_score_arguments()`**: Scores multiple arguments efficiently

- **`generate_focus_report()`**: Creates markdown report with scores and status for all participants

- **`get_focus_warnings()`**: Returns warnings for off-topic arguments

**Integration**: Focus scoring runs automatically after each debate iteration, providing real-time feedback on argument quality.

### Personality System

Two frameworks:

1. **Debate Personalities** (`council/personalities.py`) - Enhanced v2:
   - **Base agents** (high-quality, diverse perspectives):
     - `Strategist Prime`: Deep systems thinking, game theory, cost-benefit analysis (depth=3, truth=0.85)
     - `Humanist Voice`: Empathy-driven, social justice focus, human welfare prioritization (depth=2, truth=0.8)
     - `Technical Architect`: Pragmatic implementer, engineering rigor, feasibility-focused (depth=3, truth=0.9)

     - `Ethics Philosopher`: Kantian/utilitarian balance, moral reasoning depth
     - `Risk Strategist`: Paranoid productive, scenario planning, probabilistic thinking
     - `Metrics Oracle`: OKR-driven, KPI designer, measurement obsessed
     - `Knowledge Synthesizer`: Cross-domain connector, pattern recognizer
     - `Execution Planner`: Implementation-first, resource optimizer, critical path

   - Each has: model, traits, perspective, persistence (0-1), reasoning_depth (1-3), truth_seeking (0-1)

2. **Council Roles** (`council/roles.py`) - Enhanced v2:
   - **Grand Moderator**: Master facilitator with Socratic method, enforces focus, decisive synthesis (depth=3, truth=0.95)
   - **Chief Logic Officer**: Aristotelian syllogism, Bayesian reasoning, fallacy detection (depth=3, truth=0.95)
   - **Voice of Humanity**: Rawlsian justice, lived experience focus, welfare prioritization (depth=2, truth=0.85)
   - **Radical Skeptic**: Critical theory, power structure analysis, assumption challenger (depth=3, truth=0.9)
   - **Wisdom Keeper**: Stoic/Buddhist integration, existential meaning, long-term civilizational view (depth=2, truth=0.85)
   - **Future Architect**: Techno-optimist, scalability focus, exponential thinking (depth=3, truth=0.85)

   - Each has: archetype, perspective, signature (speaking style), color, reasoning_depth, truth_seeking

### Client Configuration (`council/clients.py`)

`get_ollama_client()` returns Langfuse-wrapped OpenAI client:
- Base URL: `http://localhost:11434/v1` (Ollama's OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- API key: placeholder "ollama" (required by SDK, ignored by Ollama)
- Automatic tracing via `langfuse.openai.OpenAI`

### Storage (`council/storage.py`)

`autosave_json()` serializes DebateState to `debates/` folder with timestamp-based filenames.

## Development Commands

### Run Tests
No test framework currently configured.

### Code Style
Project uses Python 3.9+ with type hints. Key conventions:
- Pydantic models for data structures (`types.py`)
- Rich library for terminal output
- Streaming completions for real-time user feedback

### Analytics Module (`analytics/debate_analytics.py`)

Comprehensive debate analysis:

**`DebateAnalyzer` capabilities**:
- **Agent Statistics**: Win rates, argument count, focus scores, participation
- **Voting Matrix**: Who voted for whom, weighted by ranking
- **Argument Graph**: NetworkX graph showing argument relationships
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Tone scoring per agent (-1.0 to 1.0)
- **Consensus Progression**: How consensus evolved over iterations
- **Cross-Debate Aggregation**: Combined stats from multiple debates

**Usage**:
```python
from analytics.debate_analytics import DebateAnalyzer
from council.types import DebateState

analyzer = DebateAnalyzer(client=get_ollama_client())
analytics = analyzer.analyze_debate(state)

# Access insights
print(analytics.agent_stats["Strategist Prime"].win_rate)
print(analytics.sentiment_scores)
print(analytics.voting_matrix)
```

### Enhanced Memory System (`council/enhanced_memory.py`)

Advanced memory with learning capabilities:

**Key Features**:
- **Tags & Categories**: Organize memories with metadata
- **Memory Decay**: Exponential decay based on age (configurable rate)
- **Access Tracking**: Count and timestamp for each memory retrieval
- **Importance Weighting**: User-defined importance scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Cross-Debate Learning**: Extract insights from similar past debates
- **Export/Import**: JSON backup and restore functionality

**Enhanced Retrieval**:
```python
memory = EnhancedCouncilMemory(decay_rate=0.1)

# Record with metadata
memory.record_episode(
    question="AI Ethics",
    agent="Ethics Philosopher",
    role="philosopher",
    phase="argument",
    content="...",
    embedding=embed_text(client, content),
    tags={"ethics", "policy", "governance"},
    category="principle",
    importance=0.9,
)

# Fetch with decay and tags
results = memory.fetch_similar_with_decay(
    query_embedding=query_emb,
    limit=5,
    tags={"ethics"},
    min_similarity=0.6,
)

# Extract learning insights
insights = memory.extract_learning_insights(
    client=client,
    topic="AI Governance",
    min_memories=5,
)
```

**Memory Decay Formula**:
```
adjusted_similarity = base_similarity × exp(-decay_rate × age_days) × (0.5 + 0.5 × importance)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Prompt Engineering for Focus

The system uses strict prompts to enforce focus and prevent topic drift:

**Debate Prompts** (`council/engine.py`):
- 7-point strict rule system in every agent prompt
- Explicit instructions: "FOKUS MUTLAK", "jangan melebar", max 3-4 poin
- Truth-seeking and reasoning depth parameters
- Evidence-based argumentation requirements
- Specific engagement with prior arguments

**Judge Prompts**:
- Professional judge persona with structured evaluation framework
- 5-step decision format (summary, strongest argument, weaknesses, decision, recommendations)
- Emphasis on objective truth over popularity

**Council Prompts** (`council/consciousness.py`):
- Enhanced system prompts with ARKETIPE, PERSPEKTIF, GAYA sections
- 7 strict rules including focus enforcement
- Limited context window (last 5 messages) to maintain clarity
- Phase-specific instructions

### Focus Scoring Workflow

1. **After Arguments**: Each debate iteration, all arguments are scored
2. **LLM Evaluation**: Gemma3 model scores 0.0-1.0 with reasoning
3. **Threshold Check**: Default 0.65-0.7 for "focused" classification
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Warnings displayed immediately for off-topic arguments
5. **Visual Indicators**: ✓ green for focused, ⚠ yellow for off-topic

### ChromaDB Integration

**Migration from SQLite**:
- Replace `CouncilMemory()` with `ChromaCouncilMemory()`
- Embeddings now required for all `record_episode()` calls
- `fetch_similar()` returns scored tuples `(similarity, MemoryRecord)`
- Optional `min_similarity` threshold for filtering

**Best Practices**:
- Always generate embeddings before recording
- Use `fetch_similar()` for semantic queries
- Use `fetch_recent()` for chronological history
- Combine both in `summarize_memory()` for comprehensive context

### Adding New Personalities
Edit `council/personalities.py` `default_personalities()`:
```python
Personality(
    name="Your Agent Name",
    model="ollama-model-name",
    traits="Key characteristics",
    perspective="Viewpoint and approach",
    persistence=0.5,        # 0-1: resistance to changing position
    reasoning_depth=2,      # Complexity of reasoning requested
    truth_seeking=0.8,      # 0-1: prioritization of truth vs other goals
)
```

### Adding New Council Roles
Edit `council/roles.py` `council_of_consciousness_roles()`:
```python
CouncilRole(
    key="unique_key",
    title="Display Name",
    model="ollama-model",
    archetype="Philosophical framework",
    perspective="Analytical lens",
    signature="Speaking style",
    color="rich_color_name",
    reasoning_depth=2,
    truth_seeking=0.8,
)
```

### Modifying Consensus Logic
Edit `council/engine.py` `_consensus_from_votes()`. Currently uses first-place vote counting. Alternative approaches could use Borda count, approval voting, or ranked-choice algorithms.

### Memory Retrieval Customization
In `council/consciousness.py` `run_council_of_consciousness()`:
- Adjust `limit` parameters for `fetch_similar()` and `fetch_recent()`
- Modify `summarize_memory()` prompt in `council/memory.py` to change summarization style

### Enhanced Display Features

**Debate UI Improvements** (`council/engine.py`):
- **Header Panel**: Shows question, participant count, consensus threshold, elimination status
- **Agent Headers**: Each argument displays agent name, position, reasoning depth, truth-seeking score
- **Focus Feedback**: Real-time warnings for off-topic arguments with scores
- **Voting Table**: Enhanced with Top 3 rankings and first-choice highlights
- **Consensus Panel**: Visual status (✅ green for success, ⚠️ yellow for failure)
- **Judge Panel**: Bordered final decision with emoji header

**Color System**:
- Deterministic hash-based color assignment in `_color_for()`
- 10-color palette for debate personalities
- Fixed colors for council roles (cyan, magenta, yellow, green, bright_blue, bright_white)
- Consistent coloring across arguments, votes, and tables

**Progress Indicators**:
- Dim text for metadata and progress info
- Bold for speaker names and key information
- Color-coded streaming output per agent
- Iteration counters and phase announcements

### Color Customization
Colors are assigned deterministically in `council/engine.py` `_color_for()` using hash-based palette selection. Council roles have explicit colors in `council/roles.py`.

## Langfuse Tracing

All LLM calls are automatically traced because:
1. Client created via `langfuse.openai.OpenAI` instead of standard `openai.OpenAI`
2. Environment variables `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` are set
3. Each call appears as a trace in Langfuse dashboard with input/output/latency/cost

To disable tracing: unset Langfuse env vars or switch to standard OpenAI client.

## Notes

- **Language**: All system prompts and UI are in Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia)
- **Streaming**: Used extensively for real-time user feedback; implement via `_stream_completion()` pattern
- **Debate Outputs**: Auto-saved to `debates/` after each iteration as checkpoint
- **Memory Persistence**: ChromaDB persists across sessions; semantic retrieval automatic
- **Elimination Mode**: Optional competitive element where worst-performing agents are removed each iteration
